# Login/Sign Up Page
This project is a simple login/sign up page implemented using Python Tkinter and SQLite3. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to create new accounts, log in, and access a restricted section of an application.

# Features
User registration: Users can create new accounts by providing their desired username and password.
User authentication: Registered users can log in by entering their username and password.
SQLite3 database: User account information is stored in a SQLite3 database for persistence.
Error handling: The application handles errors such as incorrect login credentials and existing usernames during registration.
Prerequisites

# Installations
Python 3: Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
Tkinter: Tkinter is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. It comes pre-installed with Python on most platforms.
SQLite3: SQLite3 is a self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration database engine. It is also included with Python by default.
Usage

# Working
Registration: To create a new account, enter your desired username and password in the respective fields and click the "Sign Up" button.

Login: If you already have an account, enter your username and password in the corresponding fields and click the "Log In" button.

Error Handling: The application will display appropriate error messages if the login credentials are incorrect or if the chosen username already exists during registration.

File Structure
main.py: This is the main entry point of the application. It contains the code for the user interface and the event handlers for the login and sign up buttons.

database.py: This file handles the creation and management of the SQLite3 database. It provides functions to interact with the database, such as creating a new user, checking login credentials, and retrieving user information.

requirements.txt: This file lists the required dependencies for the project.
